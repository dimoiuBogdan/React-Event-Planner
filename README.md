This is one of my first React App projects. I after "learning" react for about an hour. I've watched an YouTube video that said "just start creatinga few apps, stop trying to make it perfect, just work on a project". That's why the code might be a bit dry and i certainly didn't use best practices because I don't really know them yet.
Technologies I used to build this :
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap
- Styled Components
